"""
The generic, brick-safe GRUB theme step for the Ricelin installer.

It does one thing: drop the torii theme into /boot/grub and point GRUB at it. It
never touches boot entries, never disables os-prober, never deploys a curated
menu. That keeps it safe on any machine; a wrong menu entry can leave a box
unbootable, a theme cannot. Erik's personal install-torii.sh (hardcoded CachyOS
disks, a fixed 3-entry menu, 10_ricelin, probe-sda4.sh) is the opposite of this
and deliberately does not ship.

apply(source, dry) returns the three actions it plans or ran:
  1. copy <source>/grub/themes/torii  -> /boot/grub/themes/torii
  2. back up /etc/default/grub, then set GRUB_THEME to the theme
  3. grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Under dry, each action is just {"desc", "cmd"} and nothing runs. Otherwise each
action also carries {"ok", "detail"}: every step runs via sudo, failures are
collected not raised, so the caller can report them and move on.
