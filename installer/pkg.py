"""
Package-manager operations for the Ricelin multi-distro installer. distro.py
decides what to do with each package (native, fallback, skip); this module turns
those decisions into the concrete shell argv that actually queries or installs a
package on the detected family. Building argv lists instead of running them keeps
the policy here and the running (terminal echo, sudo prompt, error handling) in
the caller, so fallbacks.py and the in-app updater share one source of truth for
how every distro is driven. The one place that does touch the system is
is_installed, a read-only DB query.
