# Ricelin

**My Hyprland setup on CachyOS. The whole shell is hand-written Quickshell, no copied dotfiles.**

I started this a few months into Linux, mostly to learn how things work. It somehow turned into my daily driver.

## The shell

Everything you see is hand-written Quickshell. One pill bar that morphs into whatever surface I need.

The pill becomes media and now playing, a calendar, the wallpaper picker, clipboard history, an audio and brightness mixer, and network and bluetooth controls. There is also an app launcher, a lock screen, and [rishot](https://github.com/Gakuseei/rishot), my own screenshot and annotation tool, which lives in its own repo so you can read all of it there.

## Stack

- WM: Hyprland, configured in Lua
- Shell UI: custom Quickshell
- Terminal: Ghostty
- Shell: fish
- Font: JetBrains Mono Nerd
- Colors: matugen, palette pulled from the wallpaper

matugen pulls a palette from each wallpaper and recolors the pill, terminal, window borders and fastfetch. The shell itself runs a warm vermilion theme I tuned by hand.

## Install

> [!WARNING]
> The installer is young. It hasn't had a clean-machine run beyond mine yet, so expect rough edges. Read `install.sh` first and keep backups. If something breaks, file a bug and say it's the installer.

One line, straight through the pipe:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gakuseei/Ricelin/main/install.sh | bash
```

`install.sh` is a thin bootstrap: it detects your distro (Arch, Debian, Fedora or
openSUSE), makes sure git and python3 are there, clones the rice into
`~/.local/share/ricelin`, then hands off to the guided Python installer. That part
walks you through a short wizard, picks the right package names for your distro,
pulls the deps and copies the configs into `~/.config`, backing up anything it
replaces. The monitor layout and GPU env are swapped for portable defaults so it
boots on any hardware; my own layout is kept next to it as `monitors.lua.example`.
Then start `Hyprland` from a TTY.

Skip the wizard with flags, passed straight through the pipe:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gakuseei/Ricelin/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --quickstart
```

```
--quickstart  core defaults, no questions
--full        also install the daily apps (dolphin, keepassxc, zathura, imv, rnote)
--sddm        also install the torii SDDM login theme
--no-deps     skip the package step, just deploy the configs
--dry-run     walk the whole flow and change nothing
```

Ricelin is a Hyprland shell. On Niri, Sway or anything else only rishot (the
screenshot tool) makes sense; grab it from [rishot](https://github.com/Gakuseei/rishot)'s own installer.

## Keybinds

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super` + `Return` | terminal |
| `Super` + `Space` | app launcher |
| `Super` + `V` | clipboard history |
| `Super` + `C` | wallpaper picker |
| `Super` + `B` | shuffle wallpaper and retheme |
| `Super` + `E` | file manager |
| `Super` + `T` | toggle floating |
| `Super` + `L` | lock |
| `Print` | rishot |

## Notes

These started as my personal dotfiles, built around my own machine. The installer neutralises the hardware-specific bits, but some paths and choices still lean on how I run things, so read before you borrow.

## Support

If Ricelin made your setup nicer, you can [buy me a coffee on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/gakuseei). I build this on my own and it keeps the work going.
